title: Welcome to Demo Projekt!
---
body:

This is a basic demo website that shows how to use Lektor for a basic
website with some pages and a blog.

But not only that. It's also a new kind of publishing web sites. Not that easy to start with, but once hooked up, I was really flashed!

Combined with Travis-CI makes it even better.
Now changed directly in GITHUB.
Or in ArchLinux at Home!
